I updated scripts/install_neovim.sh to support multiple versions in /opt/neovim.  There qare exciting changes in 0.11 and 0.12, but they'll have breacking changes from 0.10.2 which is what my current [config](https://github.com/natemarks/kickstart.nvim) supports. My plan is to refacrot my config when 0.12 is released. Supporting multiple versions lets me swap around.
